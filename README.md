In this project the Dev will:
Create a simple mortgage payment calculator app using React
Style the app using the Bootstrap framework
For this project the dev will build a web form that accepts the loan balance, interest rate, loan term in years (either 15 or 30 years) and a calculate button. Below the dev will find the algorithm you will need to implement to figure out the payment when the calculate button is clicked. When complete, the app should closely resemble the below the algorithm.

M = (P * Math.pow( 1+r ),r) / Math.pow(1+r),r)-1);
